# Canvas_DrawingApp
An attempt to make a basic html5 drawing app.
For the current version of the app, go <a href="https://nbritt27.github.io/Canvas_DrawingApp/home.html">here</a>.
# Basic Controls
In order to zoom in, simply use Ctrl+ or Ctrl-. 
Unfortunately, right now you cannot load PDFs, but a sample Daily Work is available by clicking the "Daily Work" button.
The text box at the top represents the width of your sketching tool, and you can change the color with the colored buttons beside it. 
You can place a text box anywhere by pressing the far left "A" button, and move it around and resize it.
# Saving
I am still working on a way to more easily render the page as a PDF, but for now if you press save it will take you to a print dialog. From there, select "Save as PDF" under the Destinations options and it should work. 
# Coming Soon
This is still only a few days old, and I am working on a way to allow you to load your own PDFs to edit and an easier way to save them.
# Why Use This Instead of Kami?
Kami may be best for assignments that you need to automatically save, or if you need a variety of tools. At its current state, this web app is best for shorter uses, whether it be simply note-taking, mind-mapping, drawing, or something that doesn't need many features, such as Daily Work.
